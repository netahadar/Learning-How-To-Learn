# **Learning how to learn** 
## **By Neta Hadar Itzhak**

This webpage was built as a summary task for the "HTML&CSS" modul in Yandex's Full Stack course.

In this project I've specialized in: 
  * Organizing site's files according to BEM file structure
  * Using Flexbox
  * Using HTML tags with an emphasis on semantics
  * Embedding content
  * Animations and transforms with CSS
  * Positioning
  And more...
  
 I'm planning on adding other features to the site such as comments, contact form, anchors and vendor prefixes,
 
 in order to improve my capabilities and site visibility.
